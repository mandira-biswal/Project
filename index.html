    <h1>Single Linked List</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A Single Linked List is a data structure that consists of a list of nodes arranged in a forward direction, which
        means it cannot be placed in a backward direction. If the navigation is forward only, then it is called a single
        linked list.</p>
    <p>A single-linked list is a list made up of nodes that consist of two parts.</p>

    <h1>Deleting The Single-Linked List</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Let's Take an example where we aim to store the list of numbers 45, 98 and 3 in a single linked list. </p>
    <img src="Images/imp.drawio.png" alt="">
    <p>From this list if we successfully delete the first node, what about the other nodes?
        Once the first node is removed, It will lose direct access to the subsequent nodes. The only way to reach and
        delete the second node is through the link part in the second node. We can also use the head pointer, which
        holds the address of the first node. This structure helps us to navigate properly. We need to store the address
        of the second node somewhere so that we can reach the second node even if the first node is deleted. To reach
        the second node through some pointer.</p>

    <img src="Images/in.drawio.png" alt="">
    <p>That's why we use another pointer, temp, Which will store the address of second node after deleting the first
        node of this list. In this way, we are successfully maintaining the address of the second node and making it
        easy to continue.</p>
    <img src="Images/main.drawio.png" alt="">
    
    
 
    <p> Now initially, the temp, pointer of this list will move towards the right with the help of, the temp, link it
        can access the address 2000. We have a temp pointer pointing to the second node of the list, and we have a head
        pointer pointing to the first node of this list. Now we can easily delete the first node of this list using the
        free function. After deleting the first node, we should update the head pointer to point to the second node,
        which will be the new head of the list. </p>\
    <img src="Images/use.drawio.png" alt="">
    <p>
        We need to repeat the process to delete the second node of this list. First, we would move out the temp from
        this side. After this, we would free the head with a free function then we would move the head into temp. Now
        the head is pointing to the third node of this list.
    </p>
   
     <img src="Images/hi.drawio.png" alt=""> 
    <p>Then we have to repeat the process so that we can delete the last node as well. Then we will update temp by null
        using the free function to free this node. </p>
        <img src="Images/JI.drawio.png" alt="">
        <p>We are repeating the following procedure until temp becomes NULL.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we can use a while loop which runs the  procedure until temp becomes NULL.Here the process complete</p>
